# simple_qt_renderrer

Is 3D renderer made from scratch on pure C++. Qt is using only for windowing and widgets (sliders, labels), it doesn't take part in actual rendering at all. This project was initially based on my previous work Simple_ASCII_Renderer. 

## Why?

This and previous projects were created to fulfill my interest in computer graphic programming. I was learning OpenGL  at learnopengl.com and at some point i wasn't pretty sure about my course because of lack of low-level knowledge. So I decided to make a renderer from scratch. While I was in midway, I had a computer graphics course at University course, and it made a big influence on the project too.
